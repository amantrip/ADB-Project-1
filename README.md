Project 1

a) Akhilesh Mantripragada and Yehuda Stuchins (yss2117)
b) queryExpander.py, utilities.py, transcript.txt, Makefile
c) Run "$make". Then simply enter the desired precision and query when prompted.
d) The basic outline of the program is in the main function in queryExpander.py, while most of the functionality is in the functions in utilities.py. The program prompts the user for input for the precision and the query, then it sends the query to Bing, parses the result and requests feedback from the user on the first ten results. Then, if the precision is below the requested value, it determines the two additional words to add to the query and then starts the process over again.
